# CNTK Examples: Image/Transfer Learning

## Overview

Purpose: Demonstrate how to perform transfer learning in CNTK.


## Data

We use the `Flowers` data set that contains 102 different types of flowers: ([Examples/Image/DataSets/Flowers](../DataSets/Flowers)) and a pre-trained ResNet_18 model [PretrainedModels/ResNet18_ImageNet_CNTK.model](../../../PretrainedModels). 

## Notebook

The notebook for this lab and a detailed walk through are provided in the ['Build your own image classifier using Transfer Learning'](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/Build-your-own-image-classifier-using-Transfer-Learning) tutorial on the CNTK github wiki.
