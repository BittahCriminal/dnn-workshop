# DNN Workshop Labs

## Overview

These folders contain a variety of notebooks and scripts intended as labs to support the DNN Workshop.  Content is based on material that was originally published on git ([LearningAnalytics](https://github.com/Azure/learnAnalytics-DeepLearning-Azure)).

## Data Science Virtual Machine / Deep Learning Virtual Machine

Microsoft's Data Science Virtual Machine ( [DSVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview)) is a customized virtual-machine image hosted in Azure built specifically for data-science workloads.  It comes with a number of popular tools preinstalled and it runs on Linux as well as windows Server.  A variation of the DSVM called the Deep Learning Virtual Machine ([DLVM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/deep-learning-dsvm-overview)) is optimized for GPUs and neural network workloads.  For these labs we will be running on the Ubuntu Linux edition of the DLVM. 

## Pre-requisites

These labs have the following prerequisites that are detailed out in the Setup document. 

- An Azure subscription: To obtain one if you don't already have access, see ([Get Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)).
- Create a Linux Deep Learning Virtual Machine (DLVM)
- An Xfce3 remote-desktop client (X2G0 is recommended)
- Download the git repro to the 'notebooks' folder on the DLVM
- Access Jupyterhub on DLVM remotely from laptop
