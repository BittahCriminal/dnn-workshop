# CNTK Examples: CIFAR-10 

## Overview
Demonstrate how to prepare and train on image data using deep learning with CNTK.  


## Data

We use the CIFAR-10 data set which is a popular dataset for image classivication collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. It is a labeled subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset  ([website](http://http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)).    

## Notebook

For this lab we will use two notebooks that come pre-installed with the Deep_learning_frameworks/CNTK examples: `CNTK_201A_CIFAR-10_DataLoader.ipynb` and `CNTK_201B_CIFAR-10_ImageHandsOn.ipynb`.

A detailed walk through is provided [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Tutorials) on the CNTK github wiki.
